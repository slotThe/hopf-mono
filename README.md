# Hopf Mono

My custom build of [Iosevka](https://github.com/be5invis/Iosevka)
licensed under the SIL Open Font License, Version 1.1.

- Current target: [7b39833e](https://github.com/be5invis/Iosevka/commit/7b39833e2774d3234b92501544016617ad158588)

The font is *heavily* inspired by
[Protesilaos Stavrou](https://protesilaos.com/)'s [Aporetic](https://github.com/protesilaos/aporetic) font.
The most prominent tweaked features might be
more fancy italics,
a less rounded overall appearance,
and a higher line height
(setting this to a bigger value does real wonders for text recognitionâ€”at least in my case).
