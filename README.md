# Hopf Mono

My custom build of [Iosevka](https://github.com/be5invis/Iosevka)
licensed under the SIL Open Font License, Version 1.1.

- Current target: [8c632186](https://github.com/be5invis/Iosevka/commit/8c6321868a6cf325db6fbb33492a0ec0e869c8bb)

The font is *heavily* inspired by
[Protesilaos Stavrou](https://protesilaos.com/)'s [Aporetic](https://github.com/protesilaos/aporetic) font.
The most prominent tweaked features might be
more fancy italics,
a less rounded overall appearance,
and a higher line height
(setting this to a bigger value does real wonders for text recognitionâ€”at least in my case).
